        <p class="aboutMe">My name is Ebony Fellman and I am a 40-year-old Colorado native.  I have been married for 18 years and I have two teenage children.  
        I mention that first, because I feel as though all my accomplishments have been driven by my family.  I am very proud of my children.  
        My son is a wrestler and has a brown belt in martial arts.  My daughter is an excellent dancer, and watching her dance is one of my
        favorite past times.</p> 
        
        <p class="aboutMe">Most of my professional life has been spent in the technical support of clients and their software.  I really enjoy troubleshooting and solving technical problems, 
        and a few of my jobs have even included reading and updating code. </p>

        <p class="aboutMe">On a more personal note, I have many diverse interests and hobbies.  I am a huge fan of the Food Network Channel and I love cooking 
            different and interesting meals.  This is probably because I enjoy eating different types of food.  I am a fan of art and this summer 
            I will be making a special visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, during a trip to New York.  I am very much looking forward to it.  
            I call myself a Podcast junkie because of my enthusiasm listening to podcasts during my commutes to and from work.  I like topics ranging 
            from the mysterious and bizarre, to crime documentaries, politics, science, and TED talks.  Finally, I have very eclectic tastes in music.
            I would say that music is one of my prime motivating factors. </p>
